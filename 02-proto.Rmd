This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to address the coding challenge presented by [ECMC](https://www.ecmc.org) to Peter Edstrom on January 5th, 2018.

The full challenge text can be found in [README.md](byte-reader/README.md)

## Challenge Goals

Parse [data.dat](byte-reader/data.dat) and answer the five questions:
# What is the total amount in dollars of debits? 
# What is the total amount in dollars of credits? 
# How many autopays were started?
# How many autopays were ended?
# What is balance of user ID 2456938384156277127?

## Setup

Attempted to use the `character()` encoding, but that is dependent on a zero-terminator character string. Had to return to reading `raw()` encoding and convert to String afterwords. 

```{r}
to.read = file("byte-reader/data.dat", "rb")
#magic_string
rawToChar(readBin(to.read, raw()))
rawToChar(readBin(to.read, raw()))
rawToChar(readBin(to.read, raw()))
rawToChar(readBin(to.read, raw()))

#to.read = file("byte-reader/data.dat", "rb")
#readBin(to.read, character(), n=1, size=4)
```
